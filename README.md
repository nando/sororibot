_"The purest thing that exists it the mixture"_, Paco de Lucía.

_"The lie have no rhythm"_, Raúl Rodríguez in _Let the rhythm lead_.

Sororibot is a _digital housekeeper_ (aka bot) which helps a feminist community to keep its sorority level high. Here sorority is about the natural cyclic hormone of its members, and the challenge of the housekeeper is to open the community to constant hormone members without lowering its sorority level.

Using others words, with _dimensions_ instead of _hormonalization_. Original sorority members which live life in four dimensions (_4D_) open its digital community to members that only live life in one dimension (_1D_). Sororibot's main purpose is to help them to keep the community clean of _1D_ views of the world, letting everyone to see it, at least, in _3D_.
